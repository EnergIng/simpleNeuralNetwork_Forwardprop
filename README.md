# simpleNeuralNetwork_Forwardprop
This is my first approach to neural network and starting from the theory I'm trying to implement a simple neural network with only forward propagation. The net has 2 input node, 1 hidden layer made of 3 node and 1 output layer made of one node. Any suggestion in order to make my network more efficient and complex is welcomed
